# Description
This website allows users to check weather data from any city by using the search tool. The user may search for multiple cities and find the 5 day weather forecast for that city with relevant data related to date, temperature, humidity, and wind in that city. The user may also view the current date on a larger screen at the top of the page.

# Known Bugs
- Todays data is currently not displayed at the top of the page
- UV data is not included in the API dataset and would require another API to display
- Code should be written to eliminate user bugs when incorrect entries are made in the search section
- No dynamic imagery is displayed in the 5 day forecast
- Incorrect date seems to be displayed currently in the 5 day forecast, wrong conversion?
- If more than one entry is made, grid 5 day forecast displays on top of eachother. Need to create is so that the last entry dissapears before the new entry is displayed or so that the next entry displays below the current entry
- Need to add save data features for local storage
